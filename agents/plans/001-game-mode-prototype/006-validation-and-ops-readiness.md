# Validation and Ops Readiness

## Spec

Establish testing coverage, observability, and deployment procedures that ensure the prototype can be exercised reliably in development and promoted safely to production.

## Tasks

- [ ] **Author Rust unit and integration tests** — validate Durable Object logic.
      Add tests covering token flows, move validation, state transitions, and timeout handling using workers-rs test utilities or mock storage, ensuring CI-ready execution.
- [ ] **Create web end-to-end smoke tests** — exercise key user journeys.
      Implement Playwright/Cypress specs that create a game, join via invitation, play a few moves, and observe result handling, using test tokens and mocked clocks where possible.
- [ ] **Instrument logging and metrics** — add observability hooks.
      Standardize structured logs for major events, expose counters/timers for games started, moves processed, disconnects, and integrate with Cloudflare Workers analytics or custom telemetry sinks.
- [ ] **Document local and CI workflows** — capture commands for devs and automation.
      Update project docs with instructions for running tests, linting, wrangler dev sessions, and include CI pipeline config or updates to ensure the new crate builds and deploys.
- [ ] **Prepare deployment and rollback procedures** — outline promotion steps.
      Define how to deploy via Wrangler environments, manage Durable Object migrations, handle schema upgrades, and document rollback strategies or feature flag toggles.

## Questions

None.

## Notes

- Consider adding synthetic monitoring scripts post-deploy to verify WebSocket connectivity and move submission.
- Align CI additions with existing GitHub Actions or other automation currently configured in the repo.
